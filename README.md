#What did you do particularly well in developing this doc
umentation?
I believe I did a good job 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It really helped me keep track of which tasks I needed to complete, and helped me avoid spending time on anything unrelated to the project.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
