# CS230: Cross-Platform Game Development for "Draw It or Lose It" 🎮

## Introduction

Welcome to the portfolio piece that demonstrates my skills in cross-platform development, project management, and user-centric design. In this simulated project for a hypothetical client, "The Gaming Room," I faced the task of adapting an Android game, "Draw It or Lose It," for multiple platforms.

## Documenting for Success 📄

Documentation might not be the flashiest part of development, but it's vital for ensuring that everyone is on the same page. My approach focused on clear articulation and supportive data, establishing a reliable foundation for development and future scaling.

## Guided by a Design Document 🗺️

Navigating a project without a plan is like sailing without a compass. Utilizing a well-structured design document helped align my tasks with project objectives, enabling me to focus on what truly mattered.

## User-Centric Approach 🎯

This project underscored the critical nature of paying attention to user needs. By aligning closely with the simulated user requirements, I practiced tailoring an application that isn’t just functional but also intuitive and engaging.

## Lessons Learned & Continuous Improvement 🔄

Though the project was a simulation, the challenges were real. If I were to revisit any aspect, it would be the 'Recommendations' section to provide clearer, actionable insights for potential improvements. 

## Development Philosophy 🛠️

During this project, I maintained a focus on fulfilling the client's specifications while also adhering to best practices in software development. Lessons from this project will inform my future endeavors, such as leveraging design documents and focusing on user-driven design to build effective and efficient software.

## Conclusion

Through this academic project, I honed my skills in cross-platform development, planning, and empathetic user design. This repository serves as a testament to my growing capabilities in these areas. Feel free to delve deeper into the code and documentation to see my approach in action. Thank you for your time!
