## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client had a game called Draw IT or Lose It, and it was only available on android. They wanted to recreate their game on other operating platforms and get more customers.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I did a good job expressing my ideas and finding data to support my conclusions.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It really helped me keep track of which tasks I needed to complete, and helped me avoid spending time on anything unrelated to the project.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would probably have another look at the 'reccomendations' page,since I think I could have done a better job explaining my recommendations to the reader.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I made sure to pay attention to what the user was asking for, and tried to implement all of the features that they wanted. If you don't consider the user's needs while designing, they may be unhappy with the end result, and you'll have to spend valuable time and resources fixing your mistake.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I focused on meeting the client's needs, and tried to keep track of the features that they were asking for. In the future, I'll definitely try to use a design document while developing code.
